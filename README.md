# Project-Title-Interactive-Infographics
This project presents a dynamic and interactive web dashboard that visualizes the expansion of renewable energy capacity across different energy sources such as Solar, Wind, Hydro, Biomass, and Geothermal. It utilizes Chart.js to render bar charts, allowing users to switch between different years (2010, 2015, 2020, and 2023) to observe trends.
